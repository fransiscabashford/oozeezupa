You or (anyone) could easily follow a tutor. Currently on a 2011 Macbook Pro and am sick of the underpowered specs lol. Not getting the new ones because of the lack of ports / shitty keyboard / touchbar. This cat video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3dceIhOylg) made me lean heavily towards a fully specced out Gen7 X1 Carbon (when it comes out in June). Also open to suggestions for other laptops. I am mostly wondering what eGPU I should get. Budget: 00 (can be less, I feel like realistically, this will cost around 00). Total budget and country of purchase: 00 or less, but let me know if I’m missing something good. Buying in the USA. Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. I don’t even care for a touch screen at all, so a 2-in-1 form factor is superfluous. Battery life just needs to get me 6 non-gaming hours, but I’m willing to pay more for a longer battery life. Specs are fairly important; I need a high-cache.

Hi! I want to debug a Linux process on a remote machine from my Windows machine. I'm currently running gdb on the remote linux machine, but I'm more of a GUI person so I would prefer a different solution. What I tried so far was Cutter (radare GUI), but it seems to have problems with gdbserver. Are you guys having a tip for me? I know IDA Pro supports gdbserver, but I don't want to shell out that much money or download a leak. Is there a better alternative? Maybe a different debugging server. I landed a phone interview for a Summer internship, as a "cyber security intern." Great, right? Well the job description is painful  They're looking for someone with a bunch of networking and Linux experience, and I have effectively no experience in either; I've been studying for my Network Plus certification, but I'm not even halfway through the coursework.

I've worked mostly with ST uCs so far, and while their on-board debugger works quite well (or so I've heard) with some pro solutions like IDA, I'd rather prefer using Linux and the GNU toolchain. In this respect, stlink sucks quite bad when it comes to supporting GDB properly. Because of this, I'd like to invest some money in a proper JTAG debugger that I can use on Cortex M cores, but it's a must that it supports GDB well. What would you recommend. Total budget and country of purchase: USD in USA - Denver, CO 1500-2000 (2k is absolute uper limit) Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money?

So the new MacBooks are unveiled and I'm kind of underwhelmed. I'm currently using a 2012 13" MBP with dual core i5, 16GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD. It's starting to show its age so I'm in the early stages of looking for a replacement. I was going to go with the 15" MBP but it's pretty expensive for what it is. I've been a Mac notebook user since 2008 and haven't paid a lot of attention to the mobile PC world, so I figured I'd ask here for suggestions. I have a desktop that dual boots Windows
